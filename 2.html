  <h2>P2P Economy 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>BREAKING DOWN 'Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Service'
Some peer-to-peer services don't involve an economic transaction, such as buying and selling, but they do bring together individuals to work on joint projects, share information or communicate without intermediation.

When a third party is removed from the transaction, there is a greater risk that the provider of the service may fail to deliver, that the service will not be of the quality expected, or that the buyer may not pay. This extra risk is often defrayed by reduced transaction costs and lower prices. Often, businesses are created with the intent of facilitating P2P transactions and reducing risk for both buyer and seller. The majority of P2P services today are offered online.

Peer-to-peer services bring together individuals, as opposed to bringing together businesses (B2B) or a consumer to a business.</p>

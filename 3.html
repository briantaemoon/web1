  <h2>P2P Lending Market 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>What is 'Peer-To-Peer Lending (P2P)'
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a method of debt financing that enables individuals to borrow and lend money without the use of an official financial institution as an intermediary. Peer-to-peer lending removes the middleman from the process, but it also involves more time, effort and risk than the general brick-and-mortar lending scenarios.

P2P lending is also known as social lending or crowdlending.</p>
